Creating a sitemap for your Next.js project is essential for SEO purposes, as it helps search engines better index your site. But manually updating this sitemap can be tedious, especially for dynamic sites. This is where automating the process with GitHub Actions comes in handy. In this article, we'll guide you through installing `next-sitemap` in your Next.js project and setting up a GitHub Actions workflow to automate sitemap generation daily.

## Step 1: Install `next-sitemap`

Before we dive into the automation part, ensure that `next-sitemap` is installed in your project. This package helps in generating a sitemap automatically based on your Next.js project's pages and configurations. To install it, run:

```bash
npm install next-sitemap
```

After installation, create a `next-sitemap.js` or `next-sitemap.config.js` file at the root of your project to configure your sitemap preferences. An example configuration could be:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  siteUrl: 'https://www.yoursite.com',
  generateRobotsTxt: true, // (optional)
  // ...other options
};
```

## Step 2: Update Your `package.json` Scripts

Next, ensure your `package.json` has a `postbuild` script to generate the sitemap as part of the build process. Here's an example:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "next build",
  "postbuild": "next-sitemap"
}
```

## Step 3: Setting Up GitHub Actions

Now, let’s set up a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the build process and sitemap generation.

### Creating the Workflow File

1. **Navigate to `.github/workflows` in your repository**: Create this directory if it doesn't exist.
2. **Create a new YAML file**: You can name it `sitemap_workflow.yml`.

### Writing the Workflow

In your new `sitemap_workflow.yml` file, write down the following configuration:

```yaml
name: Build and Update Sitemap

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *' # Runs at 12 AM UTC every day

jobs:
  build-and-generate-sitemap:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14' # Ensure this matches your project's Node.js version

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Build
      run: npm run build

    - name: Generate Sitemap
      run: npm run postbuild
```

This workflow is configured to run every day at 12 AM UTC. It sets up a Node.js environment, installs dependencies, builds your Next.js project, and then runs the `postbuild` script to generate the sitemap.

### Finalizing and Monitoring

1. **Push the Workflow**: Commit and push the `sitemap_workflow.yml` file to your GitHub repository.
2. **Monitor the Actions Tab**: After pushing, check the Actions tab in your GitHub repository to see the workflow status.

## Conclusion

Automating sitemap generation for your Next.js project not only saves time but also ensures that your sitemap is always up to date, improving your site's SEO. By leveraging GitHub Actions, you can achieve this automation with minimal setup. Now, your sitemap will be automatically updated daily, ensuring search engines always have the latest map of your site's content.
